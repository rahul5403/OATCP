Certainly! The algorithm uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to construct a sum n by throwing a dice one or more times. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:
We create a vector dp of size (n + 1) to store the results of subproblems. Each element dp[i] represents the number of ways to obtain the sum i using the outcomes of dice throws.
Initialize dp[0] to 1 because there is one way to get a sum of 0 (no throws).
Use two nested loops:
The outer loop (for i) iterates over all possible sums from 1 to n. The inner loop (for j) simulates the outcomes of a dice throw, ranging from 1 to 6. We update the dp array for each possible outcome. Update the dp[i] by adding the value of dp[i - j] for each possible outcome j. This step accumulates the number of ways to reach the current sum i using different outcomes of a dice throw.
The final result is stored in dp[n], representing the number of ways to construct the sum n by throwing a dice.
